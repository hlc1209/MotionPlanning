# MotionPlanning
## Real-Time Sample-based Planner with Artificial Potential Field for Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance
This is the Motion Planning Final Project created by Yukyu Chan and Hanlong Chen.

The simulation is built on top of Dawei Zhang's Geomagic Touch teleoperator project: 
Haptic-shared-control:[GitHub Pages](https://github.com/cairlab/haptic-shared-control.git).
The haptic-shared-control project provided us with the platform to simulate the environment we would later build our algorithm on.
